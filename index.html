<pre>
Studied at UPITDC took the course of Network and System, got hired at Trends and Tech as Network engineer.
 My first project was to join the implementation team to build one a network of financial company here in
 the Philippines, the project was to build the network from top to bottom, our team rack and configured 
 them till the project was complete. At that point I was doing 2 things, learning from my peers and studying 
 for the CCNP certifications. 

After passing my CCNP exam and the project is almost over I ask my supervisor to take me to a higher project,
and lucky they re-assign me to Coca-Cola Pacific IT as network engineer from there our team implemented 
3 Life Cycle Management across 4 sites in Asia Pacific while studying security field.
But it never ends there, I planning to move towards security especially as penetration tester 
which I dedicate all my time to studying the tools needed to be acquired.
